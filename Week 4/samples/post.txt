always: Run the steps inside this block irrespective of the Pipeline or Stage result.
success: Run the steps inside this block only if the Pipeline or Stage completes successfully.
failure: Run the steps inside this block only if the Pipeline or Stage fails.
unstable: Run the steps inside this block only if the Pipeline or Stage results in an unstable state (often used for test failures).
changed: Run the steps inside this block if the Pipeline or Stage result changes from the last run (for example, from failure to success).
